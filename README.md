# Elementary Editor

Elementary Editor is a minimalistic image editor supporting Crop & Rotate functionality. The app was built by the 'Build Your Own' spirit to learn Android's Custom View, Touch & Gesture handling APIs. Inspired from the talk ['How to cook a well-done MVI for Android'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls0uKLqNFz4) app uses its own-cooked MVI architecture backed by Kotlin Flows.
